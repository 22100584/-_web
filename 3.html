<p>I was a machine, it was my choice, no love in my pockets
Stick to the plan for the cash, I used to be built this way
Only businessman can survive in this damn system
What the heck, I didn't care before I met you
You make a crack in my brain
You make me feel the earthquake
You make the movie effects
Around you, Is that a new tech?
My heart is just pumping
In the mirror, there's a puppy
Did you just cast a magic spell on me?</p>
<strong> Bible says <u>“the love is the greatest”</u>
Finally I added the love system</strong>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">I feel like you, you feel like me
Maybe we're connected by this system
All the senses that I forgot I just turned on thru my whole body
Are you a sorceress, are you an angel?
Now I'm confused but don't speak out
Your magic makes me forget what I'm going through
It doesn't matter, I'm happy though im lost
I'm not curious about the reason of this feeling
I do not get it quite with my knowledge but don't tell me</p>
How beautiful all the rocks are like magic
How wonderful all the creatures are like magic
I didn't realize that I'm living in this blessing
But you opened my mind I can feel your magic
How beautiful all the rocks are like magic
How wonderful all the creatures are like magic
I didn't realize that I'm living in this blessing
But you opened my mind I can feel your magic
I didn't see the future but now I can imagine it
I didn't feel the love but now I do, it's magic!
Where are you going'
Stay here with me all night
You need to teach me more about your magical world
How can I ignore it
I can't remove it from my head since I've experienced you
24/7 all day
high enough from your atmosphere
It's supernatural
I think there's no expression to explain your magic, I'm just enjoying your spell
Your magic makes me forget what I'm going through
It doesn't matter, I'm happy though im lost
I'm not curious about the reason of this feeling
I do not get it quite with my knowledge but don't tell me
How beautiful all the rocks are like magic
How wonderful all the creatures are like magic
I didn't realize that I'm living in this blessing
But you opened my mind I can feel your magic
How beautiful all the rocks are like magic
How wonderful all the creatures are like magic
I didn't realize that I'm living in this blessing
But you opened my mind I can feel your magic
I didn't see the future but now I can imagine it
I didn't feel the love but now I do, it's magic!
(Your love is magic!
Your love is amazing!)
You turned on my vision
Now look, we're under the rainbow sky
You just turned off my fan
Finally I know what is the love
How beautiful all the rocks are like magic</body></html>
